The plugin registers an instance of the [CacheManager|http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/CacheManager.html] iterface as the @grailsCacheManager@ Spring bean, so it's easy to access using dependency injection.

The most common method you would call on the @grailsCacheManager@ is @getCache(String name)@ to access a [Cache|http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/Cache.html] instance programmatically. This shouldn't be needed often however. From the @Cache@ instance you can also access the underlying cache implementation using @cache.getNativeCache()@.

The Grails Cache plugin provides powerful and easy to use caching functionality to Grails applications and plugins.

The plugin makes significant use of the caching abstraction provided by Spring 3.1.  This user guide will focus on taking advantage of that functionality specifically within the context of a Grails application.  For information on the underlying abstraction see [The Official Spring Documentation|http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html].
